When I was a little girl I visited the a Planeterium and it was the most amazong thing ever. When you enter the its nice and cold and the seats are really comfortable. A person comes in and says a few words, then starts the show! The lights dim down as the screen starts and the big screen on the ceiling starts and its the most wonderful thing ever. 

As you look up at the screen light up aand the stars start appearing little by little. It's like you're in sace yourself.
