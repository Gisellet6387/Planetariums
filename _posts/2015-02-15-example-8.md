title: My Experience
---
The first time I ever went to a planetarium I was facinated. I saw the stars and was just mezmerised with what I saw. It was a big room with the soft chairs. I was really small but remeber that day like if it was just yesterday. The room was cold and a guy started talking explaining more about what we were about to see, then it started. The lights went off and the evolution of space started hapening right infront of my eyes. I saw stars, milkyways, the moon and sun infront of my on the big screen on the ceiling. After that day I've been wanting to go back but never got too it. I know for sure that I will return and that it will be the best experience ever.
